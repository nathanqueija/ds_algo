# Data Structures and Algorithms in Rust

This repository is a Rust library I am building to study Rust. While I'm trying to build algorithms and study their runtime complexities I'm also touching ownership, borrowing and lifetimes in Rust.
I don't recommend you to use this library in a production environment since I'm not
 taking into account all the possible performance optimizations I can apply to the algorithms. Probably you can find better libraries out there.
 Nevertheless, if you're learning Rust I still think it's worth to check it out as I'm trying to document, test and keep a file structure that is ready to be published, and I'm also working with the module system from Rust 2018.
 
 Please, feel free to open issues and contribute. The more feedback I get the more I can improve.
 
 I've been using [this course](https://www.packtpub.com/programming/hands-on-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-rust-video) to help me in this learning journey.
